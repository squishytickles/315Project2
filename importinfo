How To Import Projects into Eclipse:

1) download and unzip the project file from Github, save it somewhere on your machine
2) open Eclipse - do NOT set the workspace as the same place that you saved the project file
3) go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
4) In the Select Root Directory box, enter in the main folder containing the project you want to import
    -So for our Fanorona project, use the main file (called Fanorona) that contains the .metadata file and the other
     file called Fanorona (i.e. don't use the second Fanorona file that is in the first Fanorona file, use the first one)

That should be it. After you select that file, there should be a checkbox with the path to that file selected in the 
text box. If you can't select the checkbox then that means there is already that file in whatever workspace you're using
